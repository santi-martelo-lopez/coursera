- Add a ghost cell for viscosity
- Ask wether the cell has been updated
- Check if there are less iterations of the PPE solver when not fixing velocities inside the cylinder 
	NAN
	Do not fix velocities and set pressure to 0 inside the cylinder

- Try interpolation schemes with bigger stencil
- Create a VTK format
- Run a dam-break with very fine mesh
- Deactivate previous IBM
- Fix issue in paralalle processing
- Try using LAPACK library

- IBM course
